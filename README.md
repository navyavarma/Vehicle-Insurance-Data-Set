### Background:
Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer. Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

### The goal is:
Build machine learning model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

### Feature Descriptions:
- id: Unique ID for the customer
- Gender: Gender of the customer

- Region_Code: Unique code for the region of the customer
